<h2>Woosh: The Smart Car Parking System</h2>

<h3>Achievement</h3>
Secured a spot in the <strong>top 8 finalists</strong> out of 450+ teams across India. Woosh was the only solution selected for the finals under the problem statement of 'Finding a Car Parking System.'.

<h3>Problem Statement: </h3>
The exponential growth of urbanization in India has led to a significant increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. Because of the limited infrastructure development in our country, the current state of parking facilities in India is inadequate.

<strong>Issues</strong>faced:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Difficulty in Locating Parking: </strong>When visiting a new area, users often struggle to find a secure parking space for their vehicle.</li>
  <li><strong>Inefficient Spot Search: </strong>Within a parking lot, users must navigate the entire area to locate a vacant spot, as no guidance is provided.</li>
  <li><strong>Fuel Waste and Environmental Impact: </strong>The prolonged search for parking not only wastes time but also leads to unnecessary fuel consumption, contributing to a higher carbon footprint.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of prior information: </strong>Users receive no prior details about available parking spots or fees, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction upon arrival.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed Solution: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The admin registers the organization and generates a unique QR code, which is placed at the entry and exit points of the parking area.</li>
  <li>The QR code records the user's entry and exit times and directs them to the corresponding parking layout editor.</li>
  <li>Hardware used are <strong>Node MCU ESP 8266, Node MCU ESP 8266, 2000mAh Battery</strong> and a surface mount cover.</li>
  <li>Magnetometers, installed at the center of each parking spot, detect changes in magnetic fields when a vehicle is parked, marking the spot as occupied. This data is used to provide real-time information on parking availability.</li>
  <li>The admin creates the parking layout using the layout editor and assigns each magnetometer to its corresponding parking spot.</li>
  <li>Users sign up or log in, scan the QR code at the entrance, navigate the parking lot, and park their vehicle. Before exiting, they scan the QR code again and pay the calculated amount.</li>
</ul>
The system can work for both, open and closed parking spaces.
